# SkyNet
This is a neural-network library I wrote in Python from scratch. The only dependency is numpy, and it is completely customizable/scalable. Currently the activation functions implemented are Sigmoid, ReLU, and Linear. The only optimizer currently implemented is Stochastic Gradient Descent. The main.py is just an example of how it is used, using the classic XOR problem.
